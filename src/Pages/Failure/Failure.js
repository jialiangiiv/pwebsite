          Failure sucks, but it has taught me a lot about myself: how resilient
          i am, how far i need to go, and where i need to be. So, here is a list
          of my academic failures.

          <li>Rejected by CCS 2025 (Second round)</li>
          <li>Rejected by IEEE S&P 2025 (Second round)</li>
          <li>Rejected by CHI 2025 (First round)</li>
